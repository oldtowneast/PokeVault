# PokeVault

*What is the PokeVault?*

I stumbled across a [Pokédex someone had made in Notion](https://whatpaigeesaid.gumroad.com/l/NhCcRG) and thought *"Boy that sure would be nice if it was in Obsidian."* That's what I'm doing.  I'm building a Pokédex in Obsidian and then planned to expand it further to serve as sort of a checklist for the trading card game and perhaps also Pokémon Go, which is what turned me onto Pokémon in the first place (strange I know).
