# PokeVault

*What is the PokeVault?*

I stumbled across a [Pok√©dex someone had made in Notion](https://whatpaigeesaid.gumroad.com/l/NhCcRG) and thought to myself: *"That sure would be nice if it was in Obsidian."*  So that is exactly what we are doing!

## Building a Pok√©dex in Obsidian

- Build the Pok√©dex
- Expand it further to serve as sort of a checklist for the trading card game
- and perhaps also Pok√©mon Go, which is what turned me onto Pok√©mon in the first place *(strange, I know)*.  This element is as of yet undetermined.

## Status

The [active plugins](Active-Plugins.md) list if **out of date**.

- For now, you see what plugins are installed by going [directly to the plugins directory](/Pok%C3%A9Vault/.obsidian/plugins).

For more information, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/oldtowneast/PokeVault/wiki).
