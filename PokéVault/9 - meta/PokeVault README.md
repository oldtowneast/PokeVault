# PokeVault

*What is the PokeVault?*

I stumbled across a [Pokédex someone had made in Notion](https://whatpaigeesaid.gumroad.com/l/NhCcRG) and thought *"Boy that sure would be nice if it was in Obsidian."* That's what I'm doing.  I'm building a Pokédex in Obsidian and then planned to expand it further to serve as sort of a checklist for the trading card game and perhaps also Pokémon Go, which is what turned me onto Pokémon in the first place (strange I know).


## Status

The [active plugins](Active-Plugins.md) list if **out of date**.

- For now, you see what plugins are installed by going [directly to the plugins directory](/Pok%C3%A9Vault/.obsidian/plugins).

For more information, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/oldtowneast/PokeVault/wiki).
