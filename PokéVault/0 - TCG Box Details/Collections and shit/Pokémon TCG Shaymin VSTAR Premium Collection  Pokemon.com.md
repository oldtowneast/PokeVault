# Pokémon TCG: Shaymin VSTAR Premium Collection | Pokemon.com

> ## Excerpt
> Get revenge and blast your opponents with the powerful Shaymin VSTAR, and grow your collection with a special oversize foil card exclusive to this collection sold at Walmart!

---
Take time to stop and smell the roses with Shaymin VSTAR—then take flight into battle! In this Premium Collection, you will find this glorious Grass-type Pokémon VSTAR in both playable and oversize versions, as well as a copy of Shaymin V so you can really show off this Mythical Pokémon.

Start a comeback with Shaymin V's Revenge Blast attack, which does 60 damage and an additional 40 damage for each Prize card your opponent has taken. Finish off the match and complete your comeback with Shaymin VSTAR and its improved Revenge Blast attack, which does 120 damage and an additional 40 damage for each Prize card your opponent has taken. If any of your Pokémon are in danger of being Knocked Out, take advantage of Shaymin VSTAR's VSTAR Power, Star Bloom, an Ability that heals 120 damage from each of your Benched Grass-type Pokémon. You can never count yourself out of a battle when Shaymin V and Shaymin VSTAR are on your side.

You'll also find eight Pokémon Booster Packs to help grow your collection!
