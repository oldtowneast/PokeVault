# Pokémon TCG: Hisuian Zoroark VSTAR Premium Collection | Pokemon.com

> ## Excerpt
> Strengthen your Pokémon TCG collection and wreak havoc with this tricky pair of powerful Hisuian Zoroark cards.

---
Filled with spite and malice, Hisuian Zoroark uses illusions to confuse its opponents and play tricks on them. Luckily, it becomes an invaluable ally once you earn its trust. This Premium Collection is just what you need to get Hisuian Zoroark on your side: it includes a copy of Hisuian Zoroark VSTAR and a full-art Hisuian Zoroark V.

Hisuian Zoroark V can put on the pressure with its Void Return attack, doing 30 damage and retreating to the Bench for zero Energy. After evolving, Hisuian Zoroark VSTAR can wreak ghoulish havoc with Ticking Curse, an attack that does up to 300 damage for only 2 Energy. Not only that, but Hisuian Zoroark VSTAR can also discard your hand and draw 7 cards with its VSTAR Power, Phantom Star—an Ability that can save slow starts or accelerate you toward stellar victories.

You'll also find an oversize version of Hisuian Zoroark VSTAR that's suitable for display, six Pokémon TCG packs, and a colorful pin featuring Hisuian Zoroark!
