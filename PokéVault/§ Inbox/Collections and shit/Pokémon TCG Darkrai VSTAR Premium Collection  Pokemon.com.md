Plunge your opponents into total darkness with Darkrai! This Mythical Pokémon is a shadow master who's known for causing nightmares, and it appears in this Premium Collection as both a Pokémon V and a Pokémon VSTAR. Darkrai V's Dark Void attack hits for a powerful 130 damage _and_ makes your opponent's Active Pokémon even more vulnerable by sending it to sleep.

Evolve Darkrai V to use Darkrai VSTAR's Dark Pulse attack, which grows in strength for each Darkness Energy attached to all of your Pokémon. You can also take advantage of its Star Abyss VSTAR Power, which returns two Item cards from your discard pile to your hand.

If that wasn't enough Darkrai for you, the set also includes an oversize foil version of the Darkrai VSTAR card that you can display. You'll even get a VSTAR marker and eight Pokémon TCG booster packs to bring in even more support for your team!

The Pokémon TCG: Darkrai VSTAR Premium Collection includes:

-   1 etched foil card featuring Darkrai VSTAR
    
-   1 foil card featuring Darkrai V
    
-   1 oversize foil card featuring Darkrai VSTAR
    
-   8 Pokémon TCG booster packs
    
-   1 VSTAR marker
    
-   A code card usable in either the Pokémon TCG Online or Pokémon TCG Live
