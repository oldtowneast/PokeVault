What is the PokeVault? 

I stumbled across a Pokédex someone had made in Notion and thought "Boy that sure would be nice if it was in Obsidian". So that's what I'm doing.  I'm building a Pokédex in Obsidian and then planned to expand it further to serve as sort of a checklist for the trading card game and perhaps also Pokémon Go, which is what turned me onto Pokémon in the first place (strange I know).
