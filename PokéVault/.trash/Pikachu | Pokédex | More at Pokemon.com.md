When Pikachu meet, they’ll touch their tails together and exchange electricity through them as a form of greeting.

Pikachu that can generate powerful electricity have cheek sacs that are extra soft and super stretchy.

When it smashes its opponents with its bolt- shaped tail, it delivers a surge of electricity equivalent to a lightning strike.

Its Gigantamax power expanded, forming its supersized body and towering tail.
