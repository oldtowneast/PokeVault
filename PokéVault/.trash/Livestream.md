# Description

These livestreams will be varied in length and infrequent in consistency. They will happen when working on the PokéVault whenever that may happen, day or night.  

DISCLAIMER 🚨 My primary machine is by no means a powerhouse, and is barely setup to be streaming. It's a mishmash setup of OBS over Linux. I don't really know the ins and outs of this type of software or much about streaming in general. I had done about half a dozen stream totaling around 7-8 hours that absolutely terrible audio.  I ended up deleting those and spending a bit of time properly setting up OBS and making sure the audio sounded halfway decent in the event anyone stumbled across these videos or it piqued someones interest. Having said that, this aims to showcase me working in public and not much more.
