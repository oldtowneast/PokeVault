### All Pokémon games on Nintendo Switch ###

During the February [Pokémon Presents](https://www.imore.com/everything-announced-february-2022-pokemon-presents), we learned about the upcoming Gen 9 Pokémon games, which are releasing on November 18, 2022. Unlike previous Pokémon games, [Pokémon Scarlet and Violet](https://www.imore.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-everything-you-need-know) will provide an open-world adventure. Plenty of exciting new elements are undoubtedly in store for players.

#### Pokémon Scarlet ####

Grab this version of Pokémon Scarlet to see what exclusive perks and Pokémon are in this open-world adventure.

As is always the case with core Pokémon games, Gen 9 is releasing two different versions of the same adventure. There are usually plenty of differences between the two versions, including which Pokémon you can catch. Sometimes there are other slight story differences as well. We're excited to see what Game Freak has in store with the first open-world Pokémon games.

Pokémon's very first open-world Gen is coming to Nintendo Switch. It will release on November 18, 2022.

To do that, they will need to explore a gorgeous open world. You can even catch Pokémon in the overworld by throwing an ancient PokéBall. You also fight right in the overworld instead of going into a different battle mode.

All Pokémon games on Nintendo Switch
----------

I've been a Pokémon fan since I first got my hands on Red and Blue in elementary school. Whether you're a new Pokémon enthusiast or a veteran like me, there's so much for you to enjoy as these are some of the [best Nintendo Switch games](https://www.imore.com/best-nintendo-switch-games). Anyone excited for upcoming games should preorder Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. They're remakes of the Gen 4 games and include an adorable chibi art style that pays homage to the original adventure.

If I had to recommend only one game, it would have to be either Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield. These Gen 8 games are the third-highest-selling Pokémon games after Red and Blue, and Gold and Silver. Plus, they introduce the Wild Area, sections of the map where Pokémon can be seen walking around in the overworld. If you have a Nintendo Switch Online membership, you can even jump into Max Raid Dens and catch Pokémon with others online.

For anyone who was a huge fan of the original RPGs, I cannot recommend Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee! enough. You get to explore the Kanto region in an all-new adventure with either a special Pikachu or a special Eevee at your side. You'll take down Team Rocket, explore the original eight gyms, and can even see Pokémon wandering around in the overworld. Note that fighting is mostly removed from wild Pokémon battles and reserved for trainer or gym battles instead.

Whether you've played only one Pokémon game or you've played several, every serious Pokémon trainer should definitely use Pokémon HOME. The free service allows you to store up to only 30 Pokémon, but if you pay for the Premium subscription, you can store up to 6,000 from several different games and can trade with other trainers as well. It's the perfect way to flush out your Pokédex or get super rare Pokémon you might have missed before.
