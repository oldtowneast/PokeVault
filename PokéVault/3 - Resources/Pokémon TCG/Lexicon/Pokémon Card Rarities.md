**Reverse Holo/Parallel Set:** A reverse holo card can be any common, uncommon or rare Pokémon card. The frame of the card is holographic and some sets have special designs on them.  The "parallel" set simply refers to what is more commonly called "reverse-holo" cards. Each card has a reverse-holo version of itself, with the exception of a few full-art cards.

Holo Rare: Marked like any other rare card with a black star, the photo section of the card is covered with a holographic pattern.

Ultra Rare Card: Pokemon cards with a higher rarity, they are also marked with a black star and they usually named in several ways (changing over time with new versions): GX,EX,V,VMAX

Full Art Card: A Pokemon or trainer that the art is covering the full width of the card, the surface of the card is textured and they are marked with a black star icon that sparkles a bit.

Rainbow Card: Same as full art cards, just the surface of the art is rainbow like style with texture, these cards usually go over the original set number.

Golden Card: A full art card with texture that the whole borders and art is golden.

Secret Rare Cards: Cards that go over the original number of the set, the secret cards are very hard to pull compared to other pokemon cards, (secret rare cards also include rainbow and golden cards).

Alternative Art Cards: ALT pokemon cards showcase a certain pokemon card with the same text and abilities but with an amazing full art style card, texturized and hard to get, the cards are marked with the letter A at the bottom.

Promo Cards: Marked with a black star with promo text on it- cards that are marked as promo cards have their own set numbers, you can get them in several special products such as tins, pre-release boxes, premium editions and Elite trainer boxes.

Radiant Pokémon cards are shinies

Radiant Pokémon cards are the latest version of Shiny Pokémon cards. Radiant cards feature only shiny Pokémon and also a unique holo design exclusive to Radiant cards.

The first expansion to introduce Radiant cards in English was _Sword & Shield- Astral Radiance_. The Radiant cards feature a unique diagonal cross-hatched holo pattern and also have a special rarity symbol (**K**) to indicate the card as Radiant. The ‘K’ stands for the Japanese word ‘Kagayaku’, which translates to ‘Radiant’ or ‘Sparkling’ in English.
