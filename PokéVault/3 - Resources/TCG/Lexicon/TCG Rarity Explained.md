🔵 – **Common**
🔷 – **Uncommon**
⭐ – **Rare**

There are some cards that have **no rarity symbol**. Usually these are from a Promo set (indicated by the set symbol Promo Pokemon card rarity symbol).

# Not All Rares are Created Equal
Some rare cards are more rare than others. They all have the star symbol, but other characteristics of the card such as *holofoil vs non-holofoil* or cards with special abilities can make it more rare and more valuable.

# Holo, Reverse Holo, Full Art Holo… 

Perhaps an easier way to find valuable Pokemon cards is to look for “holo” cards… these are also called holofoil, holographic, shiny, or foil cards. 

There are several types of holo Pokemon cards:

* **Holo** – The Pokemon image is holofoil
* **Reverse Holo** – The frame around is holofoil, but not the actual Pokemon image
* **Full Art Holo** – The entire card is covered in holofoil graphics
