# [Pokémon GO Live Maps That Still Work in 2022](https://www.foneazy.com/tips/pokemon-go-live-maps/)
Pokémon GO has a variety of interactive in-game features that can help you advance further in the game.

These include Pokéstops, gyms, and Pokémon nests. Each of them provides you with different benefits. However, they are spread out across the entire globe.

You can find a lot of live maps that contain data on the locations of Pokémon Nests, gyms, and the like on the internet. The problem is that it’s hard to determine if the resources are actually accurate.

Don’t worry though, as there are a few Pokémon GO live maps that can be trusted that have been verified by the community to be reliable and accurate. We took the liberty of gathering these websites and listed them down for you.

Now, without further ado, let’s get started.

The Silph Road
----------

It is known to be the biggest and the most organized website for Pokémon GO players. We recommend checking out the guides on this site if you are a new player.

The website’s features include a comprehensive Pokédex to get the latest information on a specific Pokémon you might be curious about, and a list of maps indicating various Nest locations, both rumored and official.

For experienced players, the website has an unofficial League map made through a collaboration of dedicated Trainers. It contains information about real-life Pokémon events and meet-ups.

The [Silph Road](https://thesilphroad.com/) basically has everything you need to know about Pokémon GO, making it a great handbook for all Trainers to refer to.

SGPokémap
----------

If you are an experienced Pokémon GO player living in Singapore, you might have already heard of [SGPokémap](https://sgpokemap.com/). It is a popular Pokémon live map that was designed specifically for Singaporean Trainers.

Similar to the Silph Road, the website gives you access to various information such as recent raids, Pokéstops, and Pokémon spawns in the area.

You can also search for a specific Pokémon through the Filter option found on the Main Menu, as well as keep track of the de-spawn time so that you can plan your visits to places you wish to go to.

With the use of GPS spoofing applications, whe website is convenient and helpful for all Pokémon GO players, not just those in Singapore.

The best part is that it’s free to use, but you have the option to donate to the developers through the website.

PoGoMap for Pokémon GO
----------

Another alternative to The Silph Road is [PoGoMap](https://www.pogomap.info/location/51,507060/-0,123296/15). This website contains a comprehensive live map of all the nests, stops, raids, spawning locations, and more.

What makes it unique is that it distinguishes Gyms that could potentially hand out EX Raid Passes.

You can also get info about the current type of Pokémon spawning in a specific Nest in an area. Locating Pokéstops that have been invaded by Team Go Rocket is also made easier through this map.

Overall, it’s a well-rounded map that contains everything that you need to know to make your grinding experience a bit easier.

Pokémon Location Map Applications
----------

Aside from the websites mentioned above, there are also apps that provide the same features and information. This is a more convenient way of accessing info as you will no longer need to open your browser.

Here is a list of some Pokémon location live map applications:

1. [Poke Radar](https://www.malavida.com/en/soft/poke-radar/android/) - The app contains a collaborative map that allows you to filter and search for specific Pokémon.
2. [Poke Live Map](https://www.apkmonk.com/app/com.sisoft.pokescan/) - This is a basic Pokémon Location map that provides you with general data that can be used for your everyday grind.
3. [Radar Go for Pokemon](https://apkcombo.com/radar-go-find-pokemon-raid-gym-map/com.orangefish.app.radargo/) - Similar to most websites, Radar Go provides you with a map containing various information on all things Pokémon GO.
4. [WeCatch Radar and Map](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wecatch-radar-map/id1137814668) - The application notifies you about rare Pokémon spawns, which is helpful as you don’t need to check the app all the time.

These apps are not available on the App Store or Google Play so you'll have to download them directly from their respective websites.

To make things easier for you, we included links to them in this article. Just click on the name of the app you wish to use and it will redirect you to the appropriate website.

Use Online Forums to Find Pokémon GO Locations
----------

Every new player needs a guide on how to get started. If you are new to the game, then online forums are the best places for you to learn about it.

In these forums, not only will you be given information on the best locations, you will also be guided by experienced players on what to do in certain situations.

There are a lot of online forums on the internet that are easy to access. You can find them on platforms such as Reddit, Twitter and Quora, of which Reddit is the most widely used.

The good thing about these forums is that you can also verify the success rate of the described methods by reading the comments section.

Speaking of which, if you have any comments and queries about Pokémon GO Maps, feel free to hit us up in our own comments section down below!

How to Teleport the iPhone' GPS to the Desired Place
----------

Sadly, there will always be locations that will be out of your reach, physically speaking. In this situation, players can use GPS spoofing software to get to those locations without actually having to move.

However, choosing a reliable software is important to minimize the risk of getting penalized by Niantic. A good example of a reliable [Pokémon spoofing software for iOS](https://www.foneazy.com/tips/pokemon-go-spoofer-for-ios/) is the [MockGo](https://www.foneazy.com/mockgo-iphone-gps-spoofer/) app.

It has the GPS teleporting and walking simulation feature that allows you to “teleport” and “walk” to different locations instead of instantly appearing there from out of nowhere.

Your walking speed can be adjusted by using the slider found at the bottom of the screen. The app is also easy to use, and very convenient.

Here are the steps to change your location in Pokémon GO using the app:

### Teleport the GPS ###

1. First, download MockGo for Windows or Mac by clicking the upper buttons. After installation, launch the MockGo.
2. Next, connect your iOS device to your computer using a working lightning cable and connect it to the application.
3. Once the interface is loaded, go to the first option located at the top-right corner to teleport the GPS.
4. Search for the location of your choice on the search bar.
5. Now, adjust the pin on the screen accordingly and click on the **Move Here** button to change the GPS.

### Simulate Walking ###

1. Next, use the one-stop mode to simulate movement between two spots along real roads by choosing the second mode at the top right corner of MockGo.
2. When you have plotted the intended destination spot on the map, you can click on the **Move Here**  button to start walking.
3. You'll then need to enter the number of times you want to move before hitting **Start** to start moving.

Once you have done all the steps, you can let the app do the rest of the work for you. You can continue grinding and farming as soon as you reach your intended destination.

Conclusion
----------

Live Pokémon GO maps can make your daily grind a whole lot easier. They help not only the newer players, but the more experienced ones as well.

They provide up-to-date information on spawns, nests, and the like, so long as you are consulting the right website, of course.

The Silph Road and PoGoMap are two such maps that you can rely on for your daily Pokémon GO needs. Once you have all the information you need, you can get out there and start catching Pokémon.

If the area you wish to go to is too far, then you can use a GPS spoofer like [MockGo](https://www.foneazy.com/mockgo-iphone-gps-spoofer/) to teleport there.

With a little help from the community, you’ll become a Pokémon GO Master in no time. See you on the playing field, Trainers!
