Pokédex

Pokédex
When you go to the [National Pokédex website](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/) and go to **advanced search** you're first presented with Type & Weakness so perhaps that is how ours should be classified as well.

That is how the Notion **Pokédex v2.0** is classified as well, which is a huge inspiration for doing this in Obsidian.
