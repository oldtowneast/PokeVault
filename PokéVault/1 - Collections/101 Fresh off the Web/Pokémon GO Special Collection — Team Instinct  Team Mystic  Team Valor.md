The three teams from Pokémon GO come to the Pokémon TCG with a trio of _Pokémon GO_ Special Collections. Choose from Team Instinct, Team Mystic, or Team Valor—or collect all three! Each set includes a full-art foil promo card featuring the leader of each team: Spark for Team Instinct, Blanche for Team Mystic, and Candela for Team Valor. These Supporter cards allow you to draw two cards, flip a coin, and then (if it lands on heads) attach an Energy card from your discard pile to one of your Benched Pokémon. The type of Energy you'll attach depends on the team leader.

You can proudly show off your favorite team with the eye-catching emblem pin that comes with each collection. Six booster packs from the special _Pokémon GO_ expansion are also included!

The Pokémon TCG: _Pokémon GO_ Special Collection—Team Instinct / Team Mystic / Team Valor includes:

-   A full-art foil promo card featuring Spark, Blanche, or Candela
    
-   A deluxe pin featuring the emblem of Team Instinct, Team Mystic, or Team Valor
    
-   6 Pokémon TCG: _Pokémon GO_ booster packs
    
-   A code card usable in either the Pokémon TCG Online or Pokémon TCG Live
    

The Pokémon TCG: _Pokémon GO_ Special Collection—Team Instinct / Team Mystic / Team Valor are available in the Pokémon Center and where Pokémon TCG products are sold.
