> Choose from Hisuian Decidueye V, Hisuian Typhlosion V, or Hisuian Samurott V in a trio of tins.

---
Hailing from the ancient region of Hisui, a trio of partner Pokémon with unique strengths are eager to join your deck! With this Divergent Powers Tin, you can choose the keen eye of Hisuian Decidueye V, whose Close-Quarters Shooting does damage regardless of any effects on your opponent's Active Pokémon. Or pick the fearsome Hisuian Typhlosion V and its Petrifying Flame, who does 120 damage and forces your opponent to reveal a card from their hand before shuffling it back into their deck. There's also the mighty Hisuian Samurott V and its Shadow Slash attack that does an impressive 180 damage but requires you to discard an Energy from the Pokémon.

Whichever you choose, you'll find even more useful Pokémon and Trainer cards in a handful of Pokémon TCG booster packs.

The Pokémon TCG: Divergent Powers Tin includes:

- A foil promo card featuring Hisuian Decidueye V, Hisuian Typhlosion V, or Hisuian Samurott V
- 5 Pokémon TCG booster packs
- A code card usable in either the Pokémon TCG Online or Pokémon TCG Live

The Pokémon TCG: Divergent Powers Tin is available in the Pokémon Center and where Pokémon TCG products are sold.
