# Pokémon TCG: Deoxys/Zeraora VMAX & VSTAR Battle Box | Pokemon.com

> ## Excerpt
> Two VMAX & VSTAR Battle Boxes bring the might of these Mythical Pokémon to your Pokémon TCG deck.

---
Pick a Mythical Pokémon to stand by your side! There are two different VMAX & VSTAR Battle Boxes to choose from—whether you pick Deoxys or Zeraora, the star Pokémon arrives as a trio of powerful Pokémon V that can take your deck to the next level!

You can evolve Deoxys V to harness the high HP of Deoxys VMAX in Defense Forme or the devastating VSTAR Power of Deoxys VSTAR in Attack Forme. Deoxys VSTAR uses its Psychic Javelin attack to hit your opponent's Active Pokémon for 190, plus 60 damage to 1 of their Benched Pokémon V. With good timing, you can do a lot of damage with its powerful Star Force VSTAR Power, which does 60 damage for each Energy attached to both Active Pokémon.

Evolve Zeraora V to counter your opponent's strategy with the hard-hitting attacks of Zeraora VMAX or the lightning-striking VSTAR Power of Zeraora VSTAR. This devastating Lightning Storm Star VSTAR Power lets you launch a barrage of four hits on any of your opponent's Pokémon, each doing 60 damage (and yes, you can strike the same Pokémon multiple times!).

These Battle Boxes also include an awesome oversize card showing off the featured Pokémon VSTAR, booster packs, a strategy guide, and a VSTAR marker for battle. Choose your Battle Forme or send in the storm with Deoxys and Zeraora!
